# Specification Quality Checklist: Upgrade to Go 1.27

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond the explicitly requested toolchain and public contract
- [x] Focused on consumer and maintainer value
- [x] Written for project stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria describe observable compatibility and validation outcomes
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance coverage
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Technical details are limited to the technology-upgrade subject and public contract

## Notes

- The feature is itself a language/toolchain upgrade, so naming Go 1.27 and the affected
  exported stream methods is necessary subject matter rather than an avoidable design leak.
- Initial validation: 16/16 items pass.
